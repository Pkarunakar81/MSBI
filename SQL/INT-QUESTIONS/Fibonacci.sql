By default maximum recursion level supported by CTE is 100. But CTE provides an option to change it by means of the MAXRECURSION hint. 
MAXRECURSION hint value can be between 0 to 32,767. Specifying it뭩 value as 0 means no limit.



 Following are the places where we can utilize Fibonacci series:

         MERGE sort
         Search Algorithms
         Network Topology
         Lossy compression in Data encoding, Streaming Media, and internet telephony.
