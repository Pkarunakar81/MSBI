Constraint : - to specify the rule and regulations that allows or restricts what values/data will be stored in the table.

It ensures data accuracy and integrity inside the table.
It enforces us to store valid data and prevents us from storing irrelevant data.
Ex: - NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNIQUE KEY, etc.
The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

●	NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value

●	UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different

●	PRIMARY KEY - A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table

●	FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables

●	CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition

●	DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified

●	CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
