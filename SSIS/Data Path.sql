What is the Data Path and how is it different from a Precedence Constraint? 
Answer: Data Path is used in a Data Flow task to connect to different components of a Data Flow and show the transition of the data from one component to another. 
A data path contains the Meta information of the data fowing through it, such as the columns, data type, size, etc. 
When we talk about differences between the data path and precedence constraint; the data path is used in the data fow, which shows the fow of data. 
Whereas the precedence constraint is used in control fow, which shows control fow or transition from one task to another task
