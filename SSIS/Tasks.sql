Task: - carry out an individual component of work divided into the following two categories:

●	Database Maintenance Tasks

●	Control Flow Tasks

Bulk Insert Task: - used to upload vast amounts of data from flat files to SQL Server. In this process, only OLE DB connections to the destination database are supported. Container: - the set of tasks linked logically

four types of containers used in SSIS:
 
●	Task Host container- Only one task is placed inside the container. This is the default container.
●	Sequence Container – This container can be defned as a subset of package control fow.

●	For loop container – Allows looping based on condition. Runs a control fow till the condition is met.

●	for each loop container – Loop through container-based on the enumerator.

Workflow : - sequential set of instructions or commands that instruct the program executor to follow specific flow when executing tasks and containers within an SSIS package. 
Data profiling task : - analysis is done to better understand the source data's state in terms of data cleaning, data pattern identification, numbers or nulls in data, etc.

doesn't help while developing standard recurring ETL packages.
